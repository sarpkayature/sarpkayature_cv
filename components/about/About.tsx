        I created my first hand-coded webpage in <strong>2015</strong> named
        <strong> Global Ticketer</strong>. I was working in a small scale
        company which was a sports tickets trader. I saw an opportunity that,
        sports ticket traders didnâ€™t have a modern system which uses, shares API
        also modern payment systems. In the first quarter of{" "}
        <strong>2019</strong>, Global Ticketer made a great success. I{" "}
        <strong>exited</strong> my startup to
        <strong> Dorak Holding </strong>
        at the last quarter of 2019. I have more than 7 years of experience as a
        front-end developer. I have advanced knowledge of{" "}
        <strong>Javascript</strong>, outstanding <strong>React</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>Vue</strong> & <strong>CSS</strong>.
