        I created my first hand-coded webpage in 2015 named
        <strong> Global Ticketer</strong>. I was working in a small scale
        company which was a sports tickets trader. I saw an opportunity that,
        sports ticket traders didnâ€™t have a modern system which uses, shares API
        also modern payment systems. In the first quarter of 2019, Global
        Ticketer made a great success. I exited my startup to
        <strong> Dorak Holding </strong>
        at the last quarter of 2019. I have more than 7 years of experience as a
        front-end developer. I have advanced knowledge of Javascript,
        outstanding React, Vue & CSS.
